Okay, I think this is definitely better. I've gone through and fixed a lot of the issues that we talked about, and made a couple other adjustments that got weird as I started changing some of the things that you mentioned, so hopefully this is good. If not at least it's a lot closer, I think!

Thanks for the help so far!
